As a simple example, we’ll search for data sets with the keyword “icesat-2” associated with them.\nIf you haven’t already, import the library. We also use the pprint library in this example, so import it as well.\nimport earthaccess\nimport pprint\ndatasets = earthaccess.search_datasets(\n    keyword=\"icesat-2\"\n    )\nsearch_datasets queries NASA’s Common Metadata Repository (CMR) and returns a list of collection objects associated with that keyword. We can find the number of collections or CMR “hits” using len().\nprint(len(datasets))\n77\nOther parameters accepted by earthaccess.search_datasets can be found here.\nCollection objects have a summary method associated with them that we can use to explore certain metadata for the collection. We can use the built-in Python pprint module to view the summary metadata.\npprint.pprint(datasets[0].summary()))\n{'cloud-info': {'Region': 'us-west-2',\n                'S3BucketAndObjectPrefixNames': ['nsidc-cumulus-prod-protected/ATLAS/ATL08/007',\n                                                 'nsidc-cumulus-prod-public/ATLAS/ATL08/007'],\n                'S3CredentialsAPIDocumentationURL': 'https://data.nsidc.earthdatacloud.nasa.gov/s3credentialsREADME',\n                'S3CredentialsAPIEndpoint': 'https://data.nsidc.earthdatacloud.nasa.gov/s3credentials'},\n 'concept-id': 'C3565574177-NSIDC_CPRD',\n 'file-type': \"[{'FormatType': 'Native', 'Format': 'HDF5', \"\n              \"'FormatDescription': 'HTTPS'}]\",\n 'get-data': ['https://search.earthdata.nasa.gov/search/granules?p=C3565574177-NSIDC_CPRD',\n              'https://openaltimetry.earthdatacloud.nasa.gov/data/',\n              'https://nsidc.org/data/data-access-tool/ATL08/versions/7/',\n              'https://cmr.earthdata.nasa.gov/virtual-directory/collections/C3565574177-NSIDC_CPRD',\n              'https://earthaccess.readthedocs.io/en/stable/'],\n 'short-name': 'ATL08',\n 'version': '007'}\nFor each collection, summary returns a subset of fields from the collection metadata and the Unified Metadata Model (UMM): - concept-id is a unique id for the collection. It consists of an alphanumeric code and the provider-id specific to the DAAC (Distributed Active Archive Center). - short_name is a quick way of referring to a collection (instead of using the full title). It can be found on the collection landing page underneath the collection title after ‘DATA SET ID’. See the table below for a list of the shortnames for ICESat-2 collections. - version is the version of each collection. - file-type gives information about the file format of the collection granules. - get-data is a collection of URLs that can be used to access the data, collection landing pages and data tools. - cloud-info this is for cloud-hosted data and provides additional information about the location of the S3 bucket that holds the data and where to get temporary AWS S3 credentials to access the S3 buckets. earthaccess handles these credentials and the links to the S3 buckets, so in general you won’t need to worry about this information.\nFor the ICESat-2 search results, within the concept-id, there is a provider-id NSIDC_CPRD.

Data frames allow for more complex indexing, metadata, and transformations than simple tabular files.\n\nSwath – along-track measurements collected as the satellite passes over an area, usually irregular in shape and resolution.\n\nRaster / Grids – data organized into regular grid cells, each cell representing a spatial unit (e.g., 25 km × 25 km grid of snow cover).\n\nResampling – methods for transforming data between swath, raster, or other structures (e.g., nearest neighbor, bilinear interpolation).\n\nHow to work with file formats commonly found at NSIDC: In most cases, it’s best to avoid low-level libraries such as netCDF4 or h5py.

    "text": "Note: This is an updated version of the notebook that was presented to the NSIDC DAAC User Working Group in May 2022\nThis notebook demonstrates searching for cloud-hosted ICESat-2 data and directly accessing Land Ice Height (ATL06) granules from an Amazon Compute Cloud (EC2) instance using the earthaccess package. NASA data “in the cloud” are stored in Amazon Web Services (AWS) Simple Storage Service (S3) Buckets. Direct Access is an efficient way to work with data stored in an S3 Bucket when you are working in the cloud. Cloud-hosted granules can be opened and loaded into memory without the need to download them first. This allows you take advantage of the scalability and power of cloud computing.\nThe Amazon Global cloud is divided into geographical regions. To have direct access to data stored in a region, our compute instance - a virtual computer that we create to perform processing operations in place of using our own desktop or laptop - must be in the same region as the data. This is a fundamental concept of analysis in place. NASA cloud-hosted data is in Amazon Region us-west2. So your compute instance must also be in us-west2. If we wanted to use data stored in another region, to use direct access for that data, we would start a compute instance in that region.\nAs an example data collection, we use ICESat-2 Land Ice Height (ATL06) over the Juneau Icefield, AK, for March 2003. ICESat-2 data granules, including ATL06, are stored in HDF5 format. We demonstrate how to open an HDF5 granule and access data variables using xarray. Land Ice Heights are then plotted using hvplot.\nearthaccess is a package developed by Luis Lopez (NSIDC developer) to allow easy search of the NASA Common Metadata Repository (CMR) and download of NASA data collections. It can be used for programmatic search and access for both DAAC-hosted and cloud-hosted data. It manages authenticating using Earthdata Login credentials which are then used to obtain the S3 tokens that are needed for S3 direct access. https://github.com/nsidc/earthaccess\n\n\nThe notebook was created by Andy Barrett, NSIDC, updated by Jennifer Roebuck, NSIDC, and is based on notebooks developed by Luis Lopez and Mikala Beig, NSIDC.\nFor questions regarding the notebook, or to report problems, please create a new issue in the NSIDC-Data-Tutorials repo.\n\n\n\nBy the end of this demonstration you will be able to:\n1. use earthaccess to search for ICESat-2 data using spatial and temporal filters and explore search results;\n2. open data granules using direct access to the ICESat-2 S3 bucket;\n3. load a HDF5 group into an xarray.Dataset;\n4. visualize the land ice heights using hvplot.\n\n\n\n\nAn EC2 instance in the us-west-2 region. NASA cloud-hosted data is in Amazon Region us-west2. So you also need an EC2 instance in the us-west-2 region. An EC2 instance is a virtual computer that you create to perform processing operations in place of using your own desktop or laptop. Details on how to set up an instance can be found here.\nAn Earthdata Login is required for data access. If you don’t have one, you can register for one here.\nA .netrc file, that contains your Earthdata Login credentials, in your home directory. The current recommended practice for authentication is to create a .netrc file in your home directory following these instructions (Step 1) and to use the .netrc file for authentication when required for data access during the tutorial.\nThe nsidc-tutorials environment is setup and activated. This README has setup instructions.\n\n\n\n\nAt the end of this tutorial, the following figure will be generated:\n ### Time requirement\nAllow approximately 20 minutes to complete this tutorial.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first step in any python script or notebook is to import packages. This tutorial requires the following packages: - earthaccess, which enables Earthdata Login authentication and retrieves AWS credentials; enables collection and granule searches; and S3 access; - xarray, used to load data; - hvplot, used to visualize land ice height data.\nWe are going to import the whole earthaccess package.\nWe will also import the whole xarray package but use a standard short name xr, using the import &lt;package&gt; as &lt;short_name&gt; syntax. We could use anything for a short name but xr is an accepted standard that most xarray users are familiar with.\nWe only need the xarray module from hvplot so we import that using the import &lt;package&gt;.&lt;module&gt; syntax.\n\n# For searching NASA data\nimport earthaccess\n\n# For reading data, analysis and plotting\nimport xarray as xr\nimport hvplot.xarray\nimport pprint\n\n\n\n\nThe first step is to get the correct authentication that will allow us to get cloud-hosted ICESat-2 data. This is all done through Earthdata Login. The login method also gets the correct AWS credentials.\nLogin requires your Earthdata Login username and password. The login method will automatically search for these credentials as environment variables or in a .netrc file, and if those aren’t available it will prompt us to enter our username and password. We use a .netrc strategy. A .netrc file is a text file located in our home directory that contains login information for remote machines. If we don’t have a .netrc file, login can create one for us.\nearthaccess.login(strategy='interactive', persist=True)\n\nauth = earthaccess.login()\n\n\n\n\nearthaccess leverages the Common Metadata Repository (CMR) API to search for collections and granules. Earthdata Search also uses the CMR API.\nWe can use the search_datasets method to search for ICESat-2 collections by setting keyword='ICESat-2'.\nThis will display the number of data collections (data sets) that meet this search criteria.\n\nQuery = earthaccess.search_datasets(keyword = 'ICESat-2')\n\nIn this case there are 65 collections that have the keyword ICESat-2.\nThe search_datasets method returns a python list of DataCollection objects. We can view the metadata for each collection in long form by passing a DataCollection object to print or as a summary using the summary method. We can also use the pprint function to Pretty Print each object.\nWe will do this for the first 10 results (objects).\n\nfor collection in Query[:10]:\n    pprint.pprint(collection.summary(), sort_dicts=True, indent=4)\n    print('')\n    \n\nFor each collection, summary returns a subset of fields from the collection metadata and the Unified Metadata Model (UMM): - concept-id is a unique id for the collection. It consists of an alphanumeric code and the provider-id specific to the DAAC (Distributed Active Archive Center). You can use the concept_id to search for data granules. - short_name is a quick way of referring to a collection (instead of using the full title). It can be found on the collection landing page underneath the collection title after ‘DATA SET ID’. See the table below for a list of the shortnames for ICESat-2 collections. - version is the version of each collection. - file-type gives information about the file format of the collection granules. - get-data is a collection of URLs that can be used to access the data, collection landing pages and data tools. - cloud-info this is for cloud-hosted data and provides additional information about the location of the S3 bucket that holds the data and where to get temporary AWS S3 credentials to access the S3 buckets. earthaccess handles these credentials and the links to the S3 buckets, so in general you won’t need to worry about this information.\nFor the ICESat-2 search results, within the concept-id, there is a provider-id; NSIDC_ECS and NSIDC_CPRD. NSIDC_ECS which is for the on-prem collections and NSIDC_CPRD is for the cloud-hosted collections.\nFor ICESat-2, ShortNames are generally how different products are referred to.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShortName\nProduct Description\n\n\n\n\nATL03\nATLAS/ICESat-2 L2A Global Geolocated Photon Data\n\n\nATL06\nATLAS/ICESat-2 L3A Land Ice Height\n\n\nATL07\nATLAS/ICESat-2 L3A Sea Ice Height\n\n\nATL08\nATLAS/ICESat-2 L3A Land and Vegetation Height\n\n\nATL09\nATLAS/ICESat-2 L3A Calibrated Backscatter Profiles and Atmospheric Layer Characteristics\n\n\nATL10\nATLAS/ICESat-2 L3A Sea Ice Freeboard\n\n\nATL11\nATLAS/ICESat-2 L3B Slope-Corrected Land Ice Height Time Series\n\n\nATL12\nATLAS/ICESat-2 L3A Ocean Surface Height\n\n\nATL13\nATLAS/ICESat-2 L3A Along Track Inland Surface Water Data\n\n\n\n\n\nFor most collections, to search for only data in the cloud, the cloud_hosted method can be used.\n\nQuery = earthaccess.search_datasets(\n    keyword = 'ICESat-2',\n    cloud_hosted = True\n)\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can use the search_data method to search for granules within a data set by location and time using spatial and temporal filters. In this example, we will search for data granules from the ATL06 verison 006 cloud-hosted data set over the Juneau Icefield, AK, for March and April 2020.\nThe temporal range is identified with standard date strings, and latitude-longitude corners of a bounding box is specified. Polygons and points, as well as shapefiles can also be specified.\nThis will display the number of granules that match our search.\n\nresults = earthaccess.search_data(\n    short_name = 'ATL06',\n    version = '006',\n    cloud_hosted = True,\n    bounding_box = (-134.7,58.9,-133.9,59.2),\n    temporal = ('2020-03-01','2020-04-30'),\n)\n\nTo display the rendered metadata, including the download link, granule size and two images, we will use display. In the example below, all 4 results are shown.\nThe download link is https and can be used download the granule to your local machine. This is similar to downloading DAAC-hosted data but in this case the data are coming from the Earthdata Cloud. For NASA data in the Earthdata Cloud, there is no charge to the user for egress from AWS Cloud servers. This is not the case for other data in the cloud.\nNote the [None, None, None, None] that is displayed at the end can be ignored, it has no meaning in relation to the metadata.\n\n[display(r) for r in results]\n\n\n\n\nDirect-access to data from an S3 bucket is a two step process. First, the files are opened using the open method. The auth object created at the start of the notebook is used to provide Earthdata Login authentication and AWS credentials.\nThe next step is to load the data. In this case, data are loaded into an xarray.Dataset. Data could be read into numpy arrays or a pandas.Dataframe. However, each granule would have to be read using a package that reads HDF5 granules such as h5py. xarray does this all under-the-hood in a single line but for a single group in the HDF5 granule*.\n*ICESat-2 measures photon returns from 3 beam pairs numbered 1, 2 and 3 that each consist of a left and a right beam.

NASA data “in the cloud” are stored in Amazon Web Services (AWS) Simple Storage Service (S3) Buckets. Direct Access is an efficient way to work with data stored in an S3 Bucket when you are working in the cloud. Cloud-hosted granules can be opened and loaded into memory without the need to download them first. This allows you take advantage of the scalability and power of cloud computing.\nThe Amazon Global cloud is divided into geographical regions.

So we will also convert a pandas.DataFrame to an xarray object to demonstrate this workflow.\n\nUsing xarray only\nWe use the .sel() indexing method. .sel() allows us to specify a selection method as a keyword. The methods are pad which fills forward, backfill which fills backward, and nearest which does a nearest-neighbour search. If no method is selected, only exact matches are returned. For geospatial queries, this will almost always return an empty set of results.To use vectorized subsetting, the points to select have to be xarray.DataArrays. If\n\n# Create some points to select.

    "text": "Discussion\nMany grids, whether they are images or gridded data are in projected coordinate systems so that they can be displayed on a 2D screen. Converting from geographic coordinates (latitude, longitude) to image coordinates (column, row) is usually a two step process. In the first step, the geographic coordinates are transformed from a Geographic Coordinate System with coordinates latitude and longitude to the projected coordinate system of the image or grid. This is a Cartesian coordinate system with coordinates x and y, usually in meters. In the second step, the projected coordinates are converted into image coordinates. This is another Cartesian coordinate system with coordinates column and row or i and j with units grid-cells. Image coordinate systems often have the origin in the upper-left corner of the upper-left grid cell.\nIn Python the first step is easily acheived using the pyproj package. If the Coordinate Reference System (CRS) of the grid is registered in the EPSG database, defining the transformation is easily done with the EPSG codes for the CRS for the latitude and longitude coordinates and the CRS of the destination grid. Usually, latitude and longitude are in the Ensemble WGS84 CRS, which is EPSG:4326. For NSIDC gridded data, the CRS is some flavour of EASE Grid or Polar Stereographic. See the help pages for EASE Grid and Polar Stereographic for more information.\n\nBoth EASE Grid and Polar Stereographic CRS come in two main flavours Original and WGS84. For EASE Grids, these two flavours are EASE-Grid and EASE-Grid v2.0.\n\nTODO: Describe projected to image coordinate conversion\nAdd image showing the relationship between the three coordinate systems"

It also features some applications that are accessible through a web browser or as stand alone packages that need to be installed on your local machine.\nThe focus on Python not only reflects the expertise of NSIDC DAAC but also reflects the popularity of Python within the Earth and atmospheric science communities. However, we recognize that many of our users are more familiar with other programming langauges such as R and Matlab. We hope that we will be able to include these langauges as the Cookbook develops.\nUsing web or locally-installed applications is a good way to start to discover and learn about data. We often use these applications to explore datasets, find what data is available, and quickly visualize data. However, many investigations require large numbers of files to be accessed and processed. It is often more efficient to write scripts in Python or some other language to do this. In the cloud, scripts are often the only way to search for and access data. Scripts are also a way to make workflows reproducible, something that is difficult to do with a GUI application.",

The packages we use in this Cookbook are an unashamedly opinionated selection; they are the tools we like to use. We also think that these tools are the easiest to use for the types of data mananaged by NSIDC DAAC. Most of the tools have been developed so that researchers do not have to worry about the low-level details of accessing and working with often complicated data used in Earth science. This reduces the amount of code you have to write and also reduces the number of mistakes you will inevitably make.\n\nearthaccess\nearthaccess — search for and access NASA Earth science data.\n\n\nxarray\nxarray — work with N-dimensional labeled data (e.g. (time, x, y, z)).\n\n\nrioxarray\nrioxarray — add geospatial awareness to xarray.\n\n\nrasterio\nrasterio — read, write, and process raster datasets.\n\n\npandas\npandas — handle tabular data (spreadsheets, databases, CSV).\n\n\ngeopandas\ngeopandas — extend pandas to work with geospatial vector data.\n\n\ncartopy\ncartopy — map projections, transformations, and plotting for geospatial data.\n\n\nSlideRule\nSlideRule — on-demand processing and access to ICESat-2 data.\n\n\nicepyx\nicepyx — search, subset, and download ICESat-2 data with built-in metadata handling.\n\n\nsatpy\nsatpy — read, composite, and visualize meteorological satellite data.\n\n\ndask\ndask — scale computations from laptops to clusters with parallel, out-of-core workflows.\n\n\nInstalling Python Packages\nMost Python packages can be installed from the Python Package Index (PyPI) using pip.

    "text": "Discussion\nThe workflow above assumes that the NetCDF file is CF-compliant and has a grid_mapping variable and projected coordinates defined. See the rioxarray CRS management documentation if this is not the case.\nIf the dataset rio.crs is not set, the source_crs could be defined using the EPSG code or other projection information directly, without having to set the dataset crs.\nFor all datasets on projected grids, latitude and longitudes for grid cells will be 2-dimensional arrays. x- and y-coordinates for these datasets will be vectors. So 2-dimensional arrays of x and y coordinates need to be created. np.meshgrid is designed to do this.\nIf you want the latitudes and longitudes of the corners of grid cells, x and y coordinates can be incremented by half the grid cells width and height, and the resoluting projected coordinates passed to transform.transformer.\nIt is worth considering if you really need to have latitude and longitude arrays for your dataset. One reason that CF-conventions were changed, was that 2D arrays of geographic coordinates can increase the file size, especially for high resolution datasets. Projected coordinates as vectors take up much less space. Plotting tools such as cartopy can make maps without latitude and longitude. If you need to extract cell values for specific geographic coordinates, for example for a weather station or buoy, it is quicker and easier to transform these coordinates into the projected coordinate system of the dataset. The xarray.Dataset.sel or xarray.DataArray.sel methods can then be used to select the data for that location.",

    "text": "Discussion\nAs of CF v1.8, latitude and longitude coordinate variables are no longer required in CF-compliant NetCDF files, as long as projected horizontal spatial coordinates (e.g. x and y, or easting and northing) and a grid_mapping variable is provided. The grid_mapping variable defines the coordinate reference system (CRS) of the projected horizontal coordinates.\nThe easiest, and frankly best, way to read and work with NetCDF files is to use xarray. rioxarray extends the xarray package to use CRS and make geospatial tasks, such as reprojecting and regridding, easier. By setting the keyword decode-coords='all', rioxarray searches the xarray.DataArray or xarray.Dataset for the CRS. rioxarray also determines the transform or geotransform, which defines the image CRS that transforms cell coordinates (column and row) into projected coordinates (x, y). The transform is calculated from the coordinates of the data. See the rioxarray documentaton for more details.\nBoth these spatial coordinates can be accessed as follows:\nds.rio.crs\nCRS.from_wkt('PROJCS[\"NSIDC Sea Ice Polar Stereographic North\",GEOGCS[\"Unspecified datum based upon the Hughes 1980 ellipsoid\",DATUM[\"Not_specified_based_on_Hughes_1980_ellipsoid\",SPHEROID[\"Hughes 1980\",6378273,298.279411123061,AUTHORITY[\"EPSG\",\"7058\"]],AUTHORITY[\"EPSG\",\"6054\"]],PRIMEM[\"Greenwich\",0,AUTHORITY[\"EPSG\",\"8901\"]],UNIT[\"degree\",0.0174532925199433,AUTHORITY[\"EPSG\",\"9122\"]],AUTHORITY[\"EPSG\",\"4054\"]],PROJECTION[\"Polar_Stereographic\"],PARAMETER[\"latitude_of_origin\",70],PARAMETER[\"central_meridian\",-45],PARAMETER[\"false_easting\",0],PARAMETER[\"false_northing\",0],UNIT[\"metre\",1,AUTHORITY[\"EPSG\",\"9001\"]],AXIS[\"X\",EAST],AXIS[\"Y\",NORTH],AUTHORITY[\"EPSG\",\"3411\"]]')\nds.rio.transform()\nAffine(25000.0, 0.0, -3850000.0,\n       0.0, -25000.0, 5850000.0)\nIf this information is not found, all is not lost. rio.write_crs and rio.write_transform can be used to set the CRS and the transform of the dataset.\nOnce these variables are set, the horizontal spatial bounds of the dataset can be queried as described above. If all you want is the bounds in projected coordinates, these can be accessed using ds.rio.bounds().\nds.rio.bounds()\n(-3850000.0, -5350000.0, 3750000.0, 5850000.0)",

We will also need to know the short-name or concept-id of the ICESat-2 dataset we want to use.\nThe short-name can be found on the dataset landing pages for products or we can search for it.\nTo search for datasets (or Collections as NASA calls them), we use the search_datasets method. This allows searches by keywords, platform, time range, spatial extent, version, and whether data are hosted in the cloud or still archived at a NASA DAAC.\nHere, we will do a simple search using platform for ICESat-2 data. The platform and keyword searches are not case sensitive. We’ll add downloadable=True and cloud_hosted=True to further refine the search.\n\nresults = earthaccess.search_datasets(\n    platform=\"icesat-2\",\n    downloadable=True,\n    cloud_hosted=True,\n)\n\nsearch_datasets returns a Python List of data collections. We can find how many datasets were found by getting the length of that list using len.\n\nlen(results)\n\n47\n\n\nThere are 47 datasets. Because results is a list, we can access any element of that list by giving an index. Here, we’ll access the first element (0). Just change the index to see a different dataset.\nEach data collection has a summary method that returns a Python dictionary containing short-name, concept-id, and version, along with information about the file type and links to get the data.

This flip changes the order of the strong and weak beams. It also changes the reference frame of the spacecraft relative to the direction of travel, so orientations are termed “forward” and “backward”. Of course, the spacecraft itself, does not change direction of travel with respect to the reference frame of the Earth. There is also a “transition” orientation, when the yaw-flip is in progress.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGround Track\nBeam Number\nBeam Strength\nBeam Number\nBeam Strength\n\n\n\n\nGT1L\n1\nWeak\n6\nStrong\n\n\nGT1R\n2\nStrong\n5\nWeak\n\n\nGT2L\n3\nWeak\n4\nStrong\n\n\nGT2R\n4\nStrong\n3\nWeak\n\n\nGT3L\n5\nWeak\n2\nStrong\n\n\nGT3R\n6\nStrong\n1\nWeak\n\n\n\nThe flag_meaning and flag_values attributes for sc_orient can be used to interpret the sc_orient value.\n\ndt[\"orbit_info\"][\"sc_orient\"]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;xarray.DataArray 'sc_orient' (sc_orient_time: 1)&gt; Size: 1B\n[1 values with dtype=int8]\nCoordinates:\n  * sc_orient_time  (sc_orient_time) datetime64[ns] 8B 2022-07-25T23:30:00\nAttributes:\n    long_name:      Spacecraft Orientation\n    units:          1\n    source:         POD/PPD\n    valid_min:      0\n    valid_max:      2\n    contentType:    referenceInformation\n    description:    This parameter tracks the spacecraft orientation between ...\n    flag_meanings:  backward forward transition\n    flag_values:    [0 1 2]xarray.DataArray'sc_orient'sc_orient_time: 1...[1 values with dtype=int8]Coordinates: (1)sc_orient_time(sc_orient_time)datetime64[ns]2022-07-25T23:30:00long_name :Time of Last Spacecraft Orientation Changestandard_name :timesource :POD/PPDcontentType :referenceInformationdescription :The time of the last spacecraft orientation change between forward, backward and transitional flight modes, expressed in seconds since the ATLAS SDP GPS Epoch.

    "text": "Problem:\nIn spite of conventions such as CF and COARDS requiring projected coordinates to be specified for multidimensional arrays, some datasets do not contain this information. Coordinate values have to be generated. Coordinate values also need to be generated if we are creating a dataset from scratch. Grid cell height and width, and the x and y projected coordinates for the upper-left corner of the upper-left grid cell are required. In many cases (but not all), this information is found in Dataset User Guides and in A Guide to EASE Grids and A Guide to Polar Stereographic Grids. The later page required more work to get the required parameters.\nThe projected coordinates of a grid cell can be found using the following formulas:\n\\[\nx = (grid\\_cell\\_width \\times row) + x\\_upper\\_left\\_corner\n\\] \\[\ny = (grid\\_cell\\_height \\times column) + y\\_upper\\_left\\_corner)\n\\]\nThis equations assumes that the origin of the image coordinates start at row=0. and column=0. in the upper-left corner of the upper-left grid cell. So the center of the upper-left grid cell is row=0.5 and column=0.5. Adding 0.5 to row and column indices solves this problem.\nThese equations can also be expressed using linear alegebra.\n\\[\n\\mathbf{Ar} = \\\\\n\\begin{pmatrix}\na & 0 & b \\\\\n0 & c & d \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\enspace\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nrow \\\\\ncol \\\\\n1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nx \\\\\ny \\\\\n1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n= \\mathbf{x}\n\\]\nwhere \\(a\\) is grid_cell_width, \\(b\\) is x_upper_left_corner, \\(c\\) is grid_cell_height, and \\(d\\) is grid_cell_height. \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) is the augmented Affine Matrix. We can use the Affine class from the affine package to define this matrix.\nGrid cell width and height for the original EASE Grid(s) and for global EASE Grid 2.0 are defined as a fraction of the Equator so that a whole number of grid cells span the Equator. This is not strictly necessary for polar azimuthal versions of grids but in the original EASE Grid grid definitions both global and polar grids follow this convention. For EASE Grid 2.0, polar azimuthal versions of grids use whole kilometers for cell size definitions. Only the global grid uses a fractional cell size. A definitive source of grid definitions is the mapxmaps repo and the gpd files therein.\nTables in User Guides and in the A Guide to EASE Grids truncate cell height and widths, and x and y projected coordinates for the upper-left corners of upper left pixels to two decimal places. Actual values caleculated from gpd files have up to 9 decimal places.\nWhile a fraction of a millimeter or even a micron may not matter for geolocation, especially for 25 km or even 1 km grids, it does matter for operations for that compare coordinates. Consider, merging two grids using the xarray package. One grid data1 has coordinates defined using the high-precision grid parameters. The other, data2 has the coordinates defined using grid parameters truncated to two decimal places. As the workflow below demonstrates, the two coordinates do not form a common set and are concatenated.\n\nimport xarray as xr\n\nfrom affine import Affine\nimport numpy as np\n\n\ngrid_cell_width =

    "text": "Geographic Coordinate Systems\nA Geographic Coordinate System is a spherical or ellipsoidal coordinate system with coordinates latitude \\(\\phi\\), longitude \\(\\lambda\\), and height \\(z\\). Latitude and Longitude are defined relative to a reference ellipsoid. There are many reference ellipsoids, so a full definition of geographic coordinates requires a full specification of the coordinate reference system. Check! Most global datasets, GPS and satellites use the WGS84 ellipsoid.\nTwo levels of abstraction are required to define latitude and longitude. First a model of the surface of the Earth is required. This model approximates mean sea level over the oceans and continues this surface under the continents. The second step is to approximate the geoid with a mathematical definition of the surface of the geoid. A simple solution is to use a sphere. However, it is more accurate to use an Ellipsoid.\nThe latitude of a point on the reference ellipsoid is the angle formed by the normal to the reference surface at the point of interest, and the plane of the Equator or Equatorial Plane. The Equatorial plane is perpendicular to the Earths axis of rotation.",
