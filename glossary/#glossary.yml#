Coordinate Reference System: |
  A _coordinate system_ that has been referenced to an object using
  a _datum_.  For Geospatial data, this object is the Earth but
  the object could also be a ship or aircraft, or some other platform. 

Coordinate System: |
  A set of rules that define how coordinates are assigned to points.
  Examples of Coordinate systems are 2-dimensional cartesian
  coordinate systems (e.g. $(x, y)$ or $(E, N)$), 3-dimensional
  cartesian coordinate systems (e.g. $(x, y, z)$), polar
  coordinates $(\theta, r)$, and spherical $(latitude, longitude)$.
