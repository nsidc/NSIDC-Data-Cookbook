This page is currently a place holder for eventually scripting our user-facing glossary. The text that renders pulls from glossary.yml. 

```{python}
#| results: asis
import yaml

with open("glossary.yml", "r") as f:
    glossary = yaml.safe_load(f)

for term, definition in sorted(glossary.items()):
    print(f"{term}\n")
    print(f"{definition}\n")
```
