Coordinate Reference System: |
  A coordinate system that has it's position, scale and orientation
  defined with respect to an object.  This is accomplished through
  a datum.  For geospatial data this is usually the Earth.

Coordinate System: |
  A set of rules that define how coordnates are assigned to points.
  Coordinates describing locations on Earth or another object are
  refenced to a Coordinate Reference System. 
  
Geodetic Coordinate System: |
  A coordinate reference system based on a geodetic datum.

Map Projection: |
  A coordinate conversion from an ellipsoidal coordinate system to a plane.

Projected Coordinate Reference System: |
  A Coordinate Reference System derived from a two dimensional
  geodetic coordinate reference system by applying a map projection.

Projection Parameters: |
  Parameters defining a map projection.
