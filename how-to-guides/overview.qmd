## Introduction

This section of the cookbook contains **How-To Guides** to help you
solve a particular problem or task.  You can think of these How-To
Guides as programmatic recipes.  For the most part they are short.  They are
written with the assumption that you know what you want to do and have
some understanding of programming.  You can think of each How-To as a
building block that can be put together with other How-Tos to construct
a workflow.

How-To Guides are organized into the following sections:

- How to search for data (via `earthaccess`); 
- How to access data (via `earthaccess`);
- How to customize data using NASA Harmony services (via `harmony-py`)
- How to reproject and resample data;
- How to work with CF-compliant NetCDF files:
  - [How to get the bounding box of a NetCDF file in latitude and longitude](netcdf_cf.qmd)
  - [How to get latitude and longitude for the grid cells of a NetCDF file](get_latitude_and_longitude.qmd)
