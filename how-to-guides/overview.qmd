## Introduction

This section of the cookbook contains **How-To Guides** to help you
solve a particular problem or task.  You can think of these How-To
Guides as programmatic recipes.  For the most part they are short.  They are
written with the assumption that you know what you want to do and have
some understanding of programming.  You can think of each How-To as a
building block that can be put together with other How-Tos to construct
a workflow.

How-To Guides are organized into the following sections:

- How do I search for data (via `earthaccess`); 
- How do I accessing data (via `earthaccess`);
- How do I reproject and resample data;
- How do I work with CF-compliant NetCDF files
  - [How do I get the bounding box of a NetCDF file in latitude and longitude?](netcdf_cf.qmd)
