NASA Earth science data can feel overwhelming when you're new to it... there are thousands of datasets, millions of files, and many tools for accessing them.  A first step in combatting the overhwhelm is better understanding how NASA organizes, and talks about, their data.

# What Are Collections and Granules?  

## 📘 Collections  

A **collection** is NASA’s version of a “dataset family.”  
Every collection groups together many related files that share common features, such as:

- The same satellite or instrument  
- The same science product type  
- The same processing level  
- A consistent file structure   

A collection is the *group* that defines **what** the dataset is.

**Examples:**

- *SMAP L4 Global 3-hourly 9 km EASE-Grid Surface and Root Zone Soil Moisture Geophysical Data V008*  
- *ATLAS/ICESat-2 L3A Land and Vegetation Height V007*  

Collection metadata includes at least the following:

- Product description  
- Spatial & temporal coverage  
- Data provider
- Variables  
- Version 

## 📄 Granules  

A **granule** is a single file within a collection.

Each granule usually represents a **single point in space and/or time**. For example, one granule could represent:

- One SMAP orbit pass, or  
- One ICESat-2 ground track   

Granules also have their own metadata, such as:

- Timestamps  
- A spatial bounding box  
- File size  
- Variables included, etc.

Granules are what you actually **download and analyze**. It is common to need MANY granules for a specific research objective!

# NASA’s Metadata Backbone: CMR  

NASA stores all metadata (for collections *and* granules) in a system called the **Common Metadata Repository (CMR)**. CMR serves as NASA's search index, metadata database, and API system for data tools. 

CMR powers:

- Earthdata Search  
- DAAC search portals  
- APIs for programmatic discovery  
- Cloud-native data access workflows  

CMR metadata is stored using the **Unified Metadata Model (UMM)**:

- **UMM-C** → Collection metadata  
- **UMM-G** → Granule metadata  
- **UMM-Var** → Variables  
- **UMM-Svc** → Services  
- **UMM-T** → Tools  

Using the UMM allows CMR to host its metadata records in several supported native formats, with translation services available between formats. 

# Collection & Granule Names  

NASA uses structured naming so files can be indexed, searched, and recognized by automated workflows.

### 📘 Collection Names  

A collection has:

##### 1. **Long Name (Human-Readable)**  
Example:  
*SMAP L4 Global 3-hourly 9 km EASE-Grid Surface and Root Zone Soil Moisture Geophysical Data V008*

##### 2. **Short Name (Machine-Friendly)**  
Example:  
*SPL4SMGP*

##### 3. **Version**  
Example:  
*008*

The combination **short name + version** uniquely identifies a dataset within CMR.

### 📄 Granule Names

Granule names can get pretty lengthy and will include some important information about the data collection they are contained within, as well as specifics about that granule in particulat. For example, most products will have a naming "formula" that includes the following:

- Product short name  
- Date and optional time  
- Version  
- File type  

::: {.callout-note}
Not all naming structures are the same for all data products! If there is a User Guide (found on the data set landing page, NSIDC0803's linked [here](https://nsidc.org/data/nsidc-0803/versions/2)) for that product, it will explain it all for you!
