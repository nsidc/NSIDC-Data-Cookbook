#### **Programmatic**

The majority of the shorter form "How Do I's" and longer form "Tutorials" will present programmatic data access methods using Python.  We hope to expand to other languages, such as R, in the future.  

**earthaccess Python library**

`earthaccess` is a Python library to **search for** and **download** or **stream** NASA Earth science data with just a few lines of code.

>*"earthaccess revolutionizes NASA data access by drastically reducing the complexity and code required. Since open science is a collaborative effort involving people from different technical backgrounds, our team took the approach that data analysis can and should be made more inclusive and accessible by reducing the complexities of underlying systems."*
