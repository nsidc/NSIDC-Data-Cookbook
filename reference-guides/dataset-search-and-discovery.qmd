### **NASA Common Metadata Repository**

There are a variety of search and discovery methods allowing users to find NASA Earthdata from a graphical user interface (GUI) or using programmatic access methods, depending on preference.  Any search and discovery method leverages the [NASA Common Metadata Repository](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/about/esdis/eosdis/cmr) to find data of interest.

*NASA's Common Metadata Repository (CMR) is a high-performance, high-quality, continuously evolving metadata system that catalogs all data and service metadata records for NASA's Earth Observing System Data and Information System (EOSDIS) and will be the authoritative management system for all EOSDIS metadata. These metadata records are registered, modified, discovered, and accessed through programmatic interfaces leveraging standard protocols and APIs.*

*CMR is the keystone that makes NASA's Earth observation data discoverable. As a metadata repository, CMR contains Unified Metadata Model (UMM) schema records that describe individual Earth data files (UMM-Granules), collections of files (UMM-Collections), scientific details about the data files (UMM-Variables), related tools and services that act on the data files (UMM-Tools and -Services), and pertinent relationships between these concepts. Using the UMM allows CMR to host its metadata records in several supported native formats, with translation services available between formats.*
