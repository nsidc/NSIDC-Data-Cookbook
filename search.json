    "text": "Discussion\nAs of CF v1.8, latitude and longitude coordinate variables are no longer required in CF-compliant NetCDF files, as long as projected horizontal spatial coordinates (e.g. x and y, or easting and northing) and a grid_mapping variable is provided. The grid_mapping variable defines the coordinate reference system (CRS) of the projected horizontal coordinates.\nThe easiest, and frankly best, way to read and work with NetCDF files is to use xarray. rioxarray extends the xarray package to use CRS and make geospatial tasks, such as reprojecting and regridding, easier. By setting the keyword decode-coords='all', rioxarray searches the xarray.DataArray or xarray.Dataset for the CRS. rioxarray also determines the transform or geotransform, which defines the image CRS that transforms cell coordinates (column and row) into projected coordinates (x, y). The transform is calculated from the coordinates of the data. See the rioxarray documentaton for more details.\nBoth these spatial coordinates can be accessed as follows:\nds.rio.crs\nCRS.from_wkt('PROJCS[\"NSIDC Sea Ice Polar Stereographic North\",GEOGCS[\"Unspecified datum based upon the Hughes 1980 ellipsoid\",DATUM[\"Not_specified_based_on_Hughes_1980_ellipsoid\",SPHEROID[\"Hughes 1980\",6378273,298.279411123061,AUTHORITY[\"EPSG\",\"7058\"]],AUTHORITY[\"EPSG\",\"6054\"]],PRIMEM[\"Greenwich\",0,AUTHORITY[\"EPSG\",\"8901\"]],UNIT[\"degree\",0.0174532925199433,AUTHORITY[\"EPSG\",\"9122\"]],AUTHORITY[\"EPSG\",\"4054\"]],PROJECTION[\"Polar_Stereographic\"],PARAMETER[\"latitude_of_origin\",70],PARAMETER[\"central_meridian\",-45],PARAMETER[\"false_easting\",0],PARAMETER[\"false_northing\",0],UNIT[\"metre\",1,AUTHORITY[\"EPSG\",\"9001\"]],AXIS[\"X\",EAST],AXIS[\"Y\",NORTH],AUTHORITY[\"EPSG\",\"3411\"]]')\nds.rio.transform()\nAffine(25000.0, 0.0, -3850000.0,\n       0.0, -25000.0, 5850000.0)\nIf this information is not found, all is not lost. rio.write_crs and rio.write_transform can be used to set the CRS and the transform of the dataset.\nOnce these variables are set, the horizontal spatial bounds of the dataset can be queried as described above. If all you want is the bounds in projected coordinates, these can be accessed using ds.rio.bounds().\nds.rio.bounds()\n(-3850000.0, -5350000.0, 3750000.0, 5850000.0)",

    "text": "Discussion\nThe workflow above assumes that the NetCDF file is CF-compliant and has a grid_mapping variable and projected coordinates defined. See the rioxarray CRS management documentation if this is not the case.\nIf the dataset rio.crs is not set, the source_crs could be defined using the EPSG code or other projection information directly, without having to set the dataset crs.\nFor all datasets on projected grids, latitude and longitudes for grid cells will be 2-dimensional arrays. x- and y-coordinates for these datasets will be vectors. So 2-dimensional arrays of x and y coordinates need to be created. np.meshgrid is designed to do this.\nIf you want the latitudes and longitudes of the corners of grid cells, x and y coordinates can be incremented by half the grid cells width and height, and the resoluting projected coordinates passed to transform.transformer.\nIt is worth considering if you really need to have latitude and longitude arrays for your dataset. One reason that CF-conventions were changed, was that 2D arrays of geographic coordinates can increase the file size, especially for high resolution datasets. Projected coordinates as vectors take up much less space. Plotting tools such as cartopy can make maps without latitude and longitude. If you need to extract cell values for specific geographic coordinates, for example for a weather station or buoy, it is quicker and easier to transform these coordinates into the projected coordinate system of the dataset. The xarray.Dataset.sel or xarray.DataArray.sel methods can then be used to select the data for that location.",

Latitude and Longitude are defined relative to a reference ellipsoid. There are many reference ellipsoids, so a full definition of geographic coordinates requires a full specification of the coordinate reference system. Check! Most global datasets, GPS and satellites use the WGS84 ellipsoid.\nTwo levels of abstraction are required to define latitude and longitude. First a model of the surface of the Earth is required. This model approximates mean sea level over the oceans and continues this surface under the continents. The second step is to approximate the geoid with a mathematical definition of the surface of the geoid. A simple solution is to use a sphere. However, it is more accurate to use an Ellipsoid.\nThe latitude of a point on the reference ellipsoid is the angle formed by the normal to the reference surface at the point of interest, and the plane of the Equator or Equatorial Plane. The Equatorial plane is perpendicular to the Earths axis of rotation.",

Coordinate values have to be generated. Coordinate values also need to be generated if we are creating a dataset from scratch.

In many cases (but not all), this information is found in Dataset User Guides and in A Guide to EASE Grids and A Guide to Polar Stereographic Grids. The later page required more work to get the required parameters.\nThe projected coordinates of a grid cell can be found using the following formulas:\n\\[\nx = (grid\\_cell\\_width \\times row) + x\\_upper\\_left\\_corner\n\\] \\[\ny = (grid\\_cell\\_height \\times column) + y\\_upper\\_left\\_corner)\n\\]\nThis equations assumes that the origin of the image coordinates start at row=0. and column=0. in the upper-left corner of the upper-left grid cell. So the center of the upper-left grid cell is row=0.5 and column=0.5. Adding 0.5 to row and column indices solves this problem.\nThese equations can also be expressed using linear alegebra.\n\\[\n\\mathbf{Ar} = \\\\\n\\begin{pmatrix}\na & 0 & b \\\\\n0 & c & d \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\enspace\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nrow \\\\\ncol \\\\\n1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nx \\\\\ny \\\\\n1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n= \\mathbf{x}\n\\]\nwhere \\(a\\) is grid_cell_width, \\(b\\) is x_upper_left_corner, \\(c\\) is grid_cell_height, and \\(d\\) is grid_cell_height. \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) is the augmented Affine Matrix. We can use the Affine class from the affine package to define this matrix.\nGrid cell width and height for the original EASE Grid(s) and for global EASE Grid 2.0 are defined as a fraction of the Equator so that a whole number of grid cells span the Equator. This is not strictly necessary for polar azimuthal versions of grids but in the original EASE Grid grid definitions both global and polar grids follow this convention. For EASE Grid 2.0, polar azimuthal versions of grids use whole kilometers for cell size definitions. Only the global grid uses a fractional cell size. A definitive source of grid definitions is the mapxmaps repo and the gpd files therein.\nTables in User Guides and in the A Guide to EASE Grids truncate cell height and widths, and x and y projected coordinates for the upper-left corners of upper left pixels to two decimal places. Actual values caleculated from gpd files have up to 9 decimal places.\nWhile a fraction of a millimeter or even a micron may not matter for geolocation, especially for 25 km or even 1 km grids, it does matter for operations for that compare coordinates. Consider, merging two grids using the xarray package. One grid data1 has coordinates defined using the high-precision grid parameters. The other, data2 has the coordinates defined using grid parameters truncated to two decimal places. As the workflow below demonstrates, the two coordinates do not form a common set and are concatenated.\n\nimport xarray as xr\n\nfrom affine import Affine\nimport numpy as np\n\n\ngrid_cell_width =

However, in most real-world situations, the points will be in a file. Something like a csv. So we will also convert a pandas.DataFrame to an xarray object to demonstrate this workflow.\n\nUsing xarray only\nWe use the .sel() indexing method. .sel() allows us to specify a selection method as a keyword.

    "text": "Discussion\nMany grids, whether they are images or gridded data are in projected coordinate systems so that they can be displayed on a 2D screen. Converting from geographic coordinates (latitude, longitude) to image coordinates (column, row) is usually a two step process. In the first step, the geographic coordinates are transformed from a Geographic Coordinate System with coordinates latitude and longitude to the projected coordinate system of the image or grid. This is a Cartesian coordinate system with coordinates x and y, usually in meters. In the second step, the projected coordinates are converted into image coordinates. This is another Cartesian coordinate system with coordinates column and row or i and j with units grid-cells. Image coordinate systems often have the origin in the upper-left corner of the upper-left grid cell.\nIn Python the first step is easily acheived using the pyproj package. If the Coordinate Reference System (CRS) of the grid is registered in the EPSG database, defining the transformation is easily done with the EPSG codes for the CRS for the latitude and longitude coordinates and the CRS of the destination grid. Usually, latitude and longitude are in the Ensemble WGS84 CRS, which is EPSG:4326. For NSIDC gridded data, the CRS is some flavour of EASE Grid or Polar Stereographic. See the help pages for EASE Grid and Polar Stereographic for more information.\n\nBoth EASE Grid and Polar Stereographic CRS come in two main flavours Original and WGS84. For EASE Grids, these two flavours are EASE-Grid and EASE-Grid v2.0.\n\nTODO: Describe projected to image coordinate conversion\nAdd image showing the relationship between the three coordinate systems"
